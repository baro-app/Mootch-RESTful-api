<h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
<br><br>
Welcome to one of the apps hosted by Blast Labs LLC ("Blast Labs LLC").  This agreement applies to all of the websites on which it is posted including Blastpress.com, and CustomerCue.com.  Use and access to the Blast Labs LLC Sites (including any rebranded or white label version of the Blast Labs LLC Sites), and the text message services, as well as any other communication services, described below (the "Services"), are subject to these terms and conditions of use (the "Terms").  
<br><Br>
We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time.  Any updates to these Terms shall be posted on this website.  You acknowledge your responsibility to review these Terms from time to time and to be aware of any such changes.  By continuing to use any of the Blast Labs LLC Sites or Services after we post any such changes, you accept these Terms, as modified.  
<br><Br>

The Services
Services described on the Blast Labs LLC Sites may or may not be available in all countries or regions of the world, may be available under different trademarks in different countries and, where applicable, may be approved or cleared by a government regulatory body for sale or use with different indications and restrictions in different countries.  You agree to use the Blast Labs LLC Services in accordance with all applicable guidelines as well as all state and federal laws that the Services are subject to.
<br><Br>

The Services consist of one or more of the following: a web-based interface, access to incoming telephone number or keywords, Direct Inward Dialing Numbers ("DIDs"), messaging applications, voice broadcast applications, SMS gateway access, data encryption, data transmission, data access, data storage and, if applicable, synchronization software, as well as software maintenance and upgrades and customer support, that enable you to send text messages and/or voice broadcasts to recipients designated by you (collectively, the "Services").  We provide MT outbound messages through different routes, and the level of reliability and support for special features varies according to the route.  You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all computer hardware, software and communications equipment needed to access the Services, and for paying all access charges (e.g. ISP, telecommunications) incurred while using the Services.
<br><Br>

Blast Labs LLC only provides that the Services are processed correctly and delivered by Blast Labs LLC to the applicable network.  Blast Labs LLC is not responsible for the final delivery of any communication initiated through Blast Labs LLC’s Services, as this is out of our control and is the responsibility of the communications carrier.  
<br><Br>

Blast Labs LLC transmits and receives text messages and voice broadcasts via major telecommunications companies and mobile network operators, and thus Blast Labs LLC’s influence over the timing of the transmission of your messages and broadcasts is within the technical constraints imposed upon Blast Labs LLC.  While Blast Labs LLC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to transmit your messages and broadcasts to the applicable network for final delivery to your designated recipients as fast as possible, we cannot commit to, and do not guarantee, a specific maximum delivery time.  Such times depend on various network and system-related factors among the various entities involved in the transportation of your messages and broadcasts across the public switched telephone network and/or Internet.  You should know that communications carriers assign text messages and voice broadcasts with a default lifetime and any message or broadcast that cannot be delivered successfully within the lifetime assigned to it will be discarded by the communications carrier without any notice.  Blast Labs LLC is not liable for any loss incurred by the failure of a message or broadcast to be delivered, and you acknowledge that damages for financial or other loss resulting from delivery failure cannot be claimed from Blast Labs LLC for any such non-deliveries.  Furthermore, you agree that message and broadcast contents are deemed to have zero value.
<br><Br>

Usage Policy
You represent and warrant that the owners of the phone numbers you provide to Blast Labs LLC, to which outbound messages and broadcasts are transmitted through the Services, have consented or otherwise opted-in to the receipt of such messages and broadcasts.  You agree that you will include clear opt-out/unsubscribe information on at least every fifth text message you send through Blast Labs LLC’s Services and otherwise adhere to the Consumer Best Practices Guidelines promulgated by the Mobile Marketing Association.  You further agree that any individual requesting "Do-Not-Call" ("DNC") status shall immediately be placed on your DNC accounts list and removed from your list of approved contacts used with the Blast Labs LLC Services and the Blast Labs LLC Sites. 
<br><Br>

You agree to familiarize yourself with and abide by all applicable local, state, national and international laws and regulations and are solely responsible for all acts or omissions that occur under your account, including without limitation the content of the messages and broadcasts transmitted through the Blast Labs LLC Services.  Without limiting the foregoing, you agree to familiarize yourself with the legalities of any messages, calls, broadcasts, and campaigns transmitted through the Blast Labs LLC Services by visiting the following websites:

DoNotCall Registry Info, http://www.donotcall.gov

This information is provided merely as a courtesy and is not intended to replace your responsibility to familiarize yourself with and abide by the legal requirements pertaining to your messages, broadcasts and campaigns prior to using the Blast Labs LLC Sites or Services.  You are ultimately responsible to make your own informed decisions regarding your messages, broadcasts, and campaigns.
<br><Br>

You shall schedule campaigns responsibly and in a manner that is courteous to the recipients pursuant to local, state, national, and international calling time rules and regulations.

You will provide your own sound files for all outbound campaigns.  Blast Labs LLC will not be liable for any misuse of the Services by you.

<br><Br>

<br><Br>

By providing any such information or materials to Blast Labs LLC (other than information required for your use of the Services as contemplated herein), you grant to Blast Labs LLC an unrestricted, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual license to use, reproduce, display, publicly perform, transmit, make derivative works of, and distribute such information and materials, and you further agree that Blast Labs LLC is free to use any ideas, concepts or know-how that you or individuals acting on your behalf provide to Blast Labs LLC.

<br><Br>

Blast Labs LLC may at its option provide you with one or more areas within the Blast Labs LLC Sites for online discussions (e.g. message boards, wikis, chat rooms, or blogs).  Should you choose to participate in such a forum, you agree not to utilize the forum for illegal or inappropriate purposes.

<br><Br>

Intellectual Property
You are permitted to access the Blast Labs LLC Sites, the Services, and any content provided by Blast Labs LLC (which may include text, images, hosted software, sound files, video or other content, and may be provided via the Blast Labs LLC Sites or otherwise) solely for the purpose of receiving information about Blast Labs LLC’s business and products, purchasing and utilizing the Services, communicating with Blast Labs LLC, entering prize promotions offered by Blast Labs LLC, or otherwise as stated on the Blast Labs LLC Sites.  Blast Labs LLC hereby grants a worldwide, fully paid-up, perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to you to use the Blast Labs LLC Sites and Services solely for the purpose of operating the Blast Labs LLC Sites and using the Services.
<br><Br>

We may have copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights covering subject matter in the Services, including the web pages that are part of the Services and the Blast Labs LLC Sites.  Except as expressly provided in these Terms, the availability of the Services and the Blast Labs LLC Sites does not give you any license to these patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property.  All copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual proprietary rights contained in the Blast Labs LLC Sites are the sole property of Blast Labs LLC or its licensors, each of whom reserves all rights with regard to such materials.  You acknowledge and agree that you may not copy, reproduce, retransmit, modify, alter, create any derivative works, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any portion of the Services or Blast Labs LLC Sites, including any proprietary communications protocol used by the Services or the Blast Labs LLC Sites without the express written permission of Blast Labs LLC.  All other trademarks or trade names are the property of their respective owners.
Data Protection & Privacy
In order to ensure your compliance with these Terms and to ensure that Blast Labs LLC complies with national and international laws, we may, from time to time, randomly check the messages and broadcasts that you send.  Nonetheless, we are committed to maintaining the privacy of your information, pursuant to our Privacy Policy, located at http://www.eztexting.com/privacy.html.  Except as otherwise required for your use of the Services as contemplated herein, Blast Labs LLC does not want you to, and you should not, send any confidential or proprietary information to Blast Labs LLC via the Blast Labs LLC Sites or the email addresses referenced on the Blast Labs LLC Sites.
<br><Br>

You further recognize that Blast Labs LLC does not want you to, and you warrant that you shall not, provide any information or materials to Blast Labs LLC that is defamatory, threatening, obscene, harassing, or otherwise unlawful, or that incorporates the proprietary material of another.
<br><Br>

Payments
Your use of the Services is contingent on your paying for such use (whether paid in advance or through the purchase of credits on the Blast Labs LLC Sites), in the amounts and using the methods indicated on the Blast Labs LLC Sites. Your payment for the Services, Credits (as defined below in Section 10), keywords, DIDs, usage-sensitive fees and/or plans (a portion of which also includes software maintenance and upgrades, as well as customer support) shall be deemed completed when Blast Labs LLC receives the full amount of payment owed for such Services, Credits, keywords, DIDs and/or plans. You are responsible to pay for any message or broadcast you attempt to send to any number, regardless of whether the message is actually received by the intended recipient. As Blast Labs LLC is dependent on other entities for the delivery of your messages and broadcasts, our price per credit may require adjustment in order to account for costs that are not in our control. Accordingly, we may adjust our prices from time to time without prior notice.
<br><Br>

Blast Labs LLC will charge your indicated method of payment for the Services, Credits, keywords, DIDs and/or plans immediately upon your confirming the payment method and amount. Amounts to be charged may include sales and other taxes where applicable and any other amounts indicated on the Site. Blast Labs LLC will assess an additional $10.00 charge for each DID number assigned to you that you request to be ported within six months of the original assignment by Blast Labs LLC, provided, however, that Blast Labs LLC reserves the right to refuse to port any DID number assigned to you by Blast Labs LLC in its sole discretion.  Your account will be credited within 24 hours of Blast Labs LLC verifying receipt of your payment. If you have elected to make a payment by credit card and we do not receive payment from the credit card issuer, you agree to pay all amounts due immediately upon demand by Blast Labs LLC.
<br><Br>

Blast Labs LLC cannot readily or accurately ascertain your location when you request to use the Services.  You therefore agree that your use of the Services occurs in Florida and is subject to any applicable Florida taxes.  To the extent that you are responsible for any additional taxes or fees beyond those collected by Blast Labs LLC, you agree that you will pay them when due to any applicable taxing authority, including any interest or penalties assessed.
<br><Br>

Blast Labs LLC shall not be responsible for any errors or transmission failures with regard to the charging and collection of funds from your indicated payment method, nor for any actions taken by the provider of the payment method you choose (which could include refusal to authorize the charge). In addition to these Terms, any payments made by you may be subject to the agreement between you and the provider of the payment method.
<br><Br>

As between you and Blast Labs LLC, you are responsible for all charges related to purchases made using your account and payment method, whether or not you authorized such purchases. Standard charges apply to any test call sent originating from your account or initiated using your API key.
<br><Br>

In the event of accidental under billing in favor of a customer, a non-payment by customer under these Terms, Blast Labs LLC shall be entitled to immediately proceed with collection remedies and shall be entitled to recover any and all costs, fees, and expenses of such collection efforts, including but not limited to: collection agencies, court costs, filing and service of process fees, attorneys’ fees incurred from counsel of Blast Labs LLC’s choosing, or any other costs, fees, and expenses incurred in the pursuit of collection on all customer accounts and receivables due and payable under these Terms.
<br><Br>

Credits
Credits are paperless vouchers that you purchase and which facilitate the transmission of the Blast Labs LLC Services selected by you.  The chosen route as well as the destination of a message or broadcast causes the amount of credits required to either increase or decrease but, in either case, will always be made known beforehand through the Pricing Page of our Blast Labs LLC Sites.  The submission of a seemingly-valid message or broadcast will cause an associated quantity of credits to be debited from your account and you can obtain the real-time status of your account at any time through the online interface.
<br><Br>

Expiration of Credits and Prepaid Minutes
Credits purchased as a part of a package or monthly plan, and not used within the month of purchase, expire at the end of the month, unless the plan explicitly provides for roll-over of credits.  Individual anytime, non-monthly plan credits purchased through your account expire after 18 months from the date of purchase (or most recent date of account recharge), at which point such credits shall expire automatically, unless otherwise stated at the time of purchase.  Additionally, the value of credits may change over time as the cost of transmission changes, and thus you acknowledge that the number of credits needed to utilize the Services may change correspondingly.  You may request a full refund of any unused, non-monthly plan credits within 1 business day of purchase.  No other refunds will be given.  Any unused value shall be forfeited upon expiration.  All prices, per-minute rates, and billing increments are subject to change at any time due to fluctuations in market conditions.
<br><Br>

No Warranty; Limitation of Liability
Blast Labs LLC reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the offering of any of the Blast Labs LLC Sites or Services at any time for any reason without prior notice.  Further, while Blast Labs LLC utilizes electronic and physical security to reduce the risk of improper access to or manipulation of data during transmission and storage, it cannot guarantee the security or integrity of the data and shall have no liability for breaches of security or integrity or third-party interception in transit, nor for any damage which may result to your computer or other property by your use of the Blast Labs LLC Sites or Services.
<br><Br>

You acknowledge that text messages and voice broadcasts are transmitted unencrypted and that eavesdropping of communications by third parties is possible.  Blast Labs LLC recommends that you ensure sensitive and valuable information is communicated by a protected and/or encrypted method.
<br><Br>

Blast Labs LLC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make access to the Services available through the required access protocols, but makes no warranty or guarantee that (i) the Services will be available at any particular time; or (ii) you will be able to access the Services at any particular time or from any particular location.  Blast Labs LLC will not be liable for any act or omission of any other company or companies furnishing a portion of the Services (including, without limitation communications carriers or ISPs), or from any act or omission of a third party, including those vendors participating in Blast Labs LLC offerings made to you, or for equipment that it does not furnish, or for damages that result from the operation of customer-provided systems, equipment, facilities or services that are interconnected with the Service.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, THE Blast Labs LLC SITES AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS WHATSOEVER, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING OR ANY STATEMENT TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS, Blast Labs LLC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE USE OF THE Blast Labs LLC SITES OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY INTERRUPTIONS TO THE SERVICES CAUSED BY THE INTENTIONAL AND/OR MALICIOUS ACTS OF THIRD PARTIES (E.G., "HACKING") NOR SHALL Blast Labs LLC BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DATA LOSS OR LOSS OF ANY INFORMATION IN YOUR ACCOUNT, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE.  FURTHERMORE, Blast Labs LLC MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE SERVICES OR THAT THE Blast Labs LLC SITES OR SERVICES WILL MEET ANY OF YOUR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OTHER THAN AS MAY BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS.  Blast Labs LLC MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COMPLETENESS, OR TIMELINESS OF THE MATERIAL, SERVICE, SOFTWARE, TEXT, GRAPHICS OR LINKS, AND ALL WARRANTIES IMPLIED FROM ANY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE.  Blast Labs LLC SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM LOSS OF USE OR LOST BUSINESS, LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED PROFITS, LOSS OF DAMAGE TO OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL), OR FOR ANY COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER ACTIONS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IF YOUR USE OF THE Blast Labs LLC SITES OR SERVICES RESULTS IN THE NEED FOR SERVICING OR REPLACING EQUIPMENT, SOFTWARE, OR DATA, Blast Labs LLC IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE COSTS.  Blast Labs LLC'S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE Blast Labs LLC SITES OR SERVICES FOR DIRECT DAMAGES SHALL NOT, IN THE AGGREGATE, EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE MONTHLY TRANSACTION FEE PAID BY YOU TO Blast Labs LLC HEREUNDER.
<br><Br>

User Warranties; Indemnification
You warrant and represent to Blast Labs LLC that you have all necessary rights, power, and authority to agree to these Terms and perform your obligations hereunder, and nothing contained in these Terms or in the performance of such obligations will place you in breach of any other contract or obligation.  You further warrant and represent that you are and shall at all times remain in full compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations with regard to your use of the Blast Labs LLC Sites and Services, including without limitation the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM Act (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act) of 2003, and all other laws and regulations concerning privacy, telemarketing, and Internet marketing.
<br><Br>

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Blast Labs LLC and its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents, contractors,  representatives, content providers and service providers, from and against any and all losses, claims, obligations, liabilities, damages, settlements, costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, consequential damages, incidental damages, special damages, disbursements and attorneys’ fees, including attorneys’ fees incurred from counsel selected by Blast Labs LLC in its sole discretion) arising from or relating to any actual or threatened claim, suit, action, proceeding, governmental investigation or enforcement action based upon or arising out of: (i) your breach of the above warranties; or (ii) any use by you, or an account or computer owned by you, of the Blast Labs LLC Sites or Services. You agree to cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the defense of any claim, suit, action, proceeding, governmental investigation or enforcement action, but we reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter in which you are a named party and that is otherwise subject to indemnification by you.  You acknowledge and agree to be held liable for any and all damages caused to Blast Labs LLC by you as a direct result of a violation of local, state, national or international laws and regulations, including but are not limited to those damages that may arise from your fraudulent, intentional or unintentional harm, disability, unauthorized use of, or destruction to any and all equipment, licensing and/or services provided by Blast Labs LLC to you.
<br><Br>

Termination, Cancellation and/or Suspension by Blast Labs LLC
If at any time you breach these Terms, we may elect to suspend, terminate, and/or cancel your use of the Services and/or recover any damages from you arising from the event(s) giving rise to the suspension, termination, or cancellation.  We reserve the right to suspend the Services at any stage for any reason we may deem necessary to continue to provide our Services in a way that may be hindered by your status as being our client, your financial status or the content of the messages or broadcasts originating from you.
<br><Br>

Upon any such termination, cancellation, and/or suspension, you are still responsible for any obligations then accrued.  Your obligation to pay all amounts accrued and owed by you shall continue even after any suspension or cancellation of your access to the Services (in whole or in part).  Upon termination, for any reason, you agree to immediately cease using the Services and Blast Labs LLC shall have no obligation to you after any termination or cancellation of these Terms.
<br><Br>

Should such a termination take place when you still have credits in your account, you shall receive back, at our discretion, a fair monetary value of such credits, save any expenses that may be incurred by Blast Labs LLC, including, without limitation, for payment of transfer duties, legal costs, third-party costs, or penalties.
<br><Br>

The provisions regarding ownership, payments, warranties, and indemnifications will survive any suspension, termination, or cancellation of your use of the Services or Blast Labs LLC Sites.
<br><Br>

Termination by the User
You are free to terminate or cancel your use of the Services at any time, and for any reason.  If you are on a monthly plan or pay for monthly Keywords or DIDs, login to your account, downgrade to Pay & Go and cancel any Keyword or DID subscriptions you may have.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless due to a breach solely by Blast Labs LLC that it fails to cure within thirty (30) days of its receipt of your notice, in no event shall Blast Labs LLC be obligated to refund to you the reasonable value of any unused credits previously purchased by you.

<br><Br>

Choice of Law and Jurisdiction
 These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida notwithstanding its laws governing conflicts of laws.  Except as hereinafter provided, any dispute arising under these Terms shall be settled and determined by binding arbitration in Santa Monica, Florida in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9.  U.S.C. §§1-16, as amended (the "Federal Arbitration Act"), to the exclusion of state laws inconsistent therewith.  The terms of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "Rules") then in effect shall apply except to the extent they conflict with the express provisions of this paragraph.  A single independent arbitrator shall conduct the arbitration.  The parties shall endeavor to select the independent arbitrator by mutual agreement.  If such agreement cannot be reached within thirty (30) days after a dispute has arisen which is to be decided by arbitration, the selection of the arbitrator shall be made in accordance with the Rules as then in effect.  The arbitrator shall be a member of a state bar engaged in the practice of law in the United States or a retired member of a state or the federal judiciary in the United States.  The award of the arbitrator shall be based on the evidence admitted and the substantive law of the State of Florida (subject to any applicable preemption or supersedence by U.S. federal substantive law) and shall contain an award for each issue and counterclaim.  The award shall be made within thirty (30) days following the close of the final hearing and the filing of any post-hearing briefs authorized by the arbitrator, and such award shall set forth in writing the factual findings and legal reasoning for such award.  The arbitrator may, in his/her discretion, award to any party specific performance or injunctive relief (the foregoing is not intended to limit Blast Labs LLC’s access to the courts to the extent provided below).  The arbitrator may not change, modify, or alter any express condition, term, or provision of these Terms or the extent the scope of their authority is expressly limited.  Except as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the arbitration award will be final and binding upon the parties and no appeal of any kind may be taken.  Judgment may be entered thereon in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Each party shall be entitled to inspect and obtain a copy of non-privileged relevant documents in the possession or control of the other party.  All such discovery shall be in accordance with procedures approved by the arbitrator.  Unless otherwise provided in the award, each party shall bear its own costs of discovery.  The statute of limitations applicable under Florida law to the commencement of a lawsuit shall apply to the commencement of arbitration hereunder.
<br><Br>

Anything in the foregoing paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding, Blast Labs LLC may seek injunctive relief in any court having jurisdiction over the parties to enjoin or prevent any action you take or threaten to take in violation of these Terms.
<br><Br>

These Terms are only those stated herein, which shall constitute the complete agreement between the parties.  No terms and conditions stated in or attached to your communications to Blast Labs LLC are applicable to these Terms in any way and are not to be considered your exceptions to the provisions of these Terms.
<br><Br>

Miscellaneous
The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.  If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Terms and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Blast Labs LLC in any respect whatsoever.  In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under these Terms, Blast Labs LLC will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees if it substantially prevails.
